   - "method_references": array of 1-3 method descriptions that could be referenced or adapted
   - "theory_references": array of 1-3 theoretical frameworks or concepts that could be cited
   - "possible_literature_review_use": a markdown paragraph (2-4 sentences) explaining how this material fits into a literature review section
   - "limitations_or_critique": a markdown paragraph (2-4 sentences) noting limitations, counterarguments, or gaps

2. "writing_materials": the full markdown writing materials in this format:
   # Reusable Writing Materials
   ## 1. Literature Review Paragraphs
   Write 1-2 paragraphs for "Related Work" or "Research Background".
   ## 2. Method Inspiration Paragraph
   Write 1 paragraph explaining how this material inspires method design.
